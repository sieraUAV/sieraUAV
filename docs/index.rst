===========================================
Welcome to DroneKit-Python's documentation!
===========================================

DroneKit's Python API helps you create powerful apps for both ground and air-based control of UAVs.

The API makes it easy for your ground station apps to get information from UAVs and automate new kinds of flight behaviour. DroneKit-Python code running on a UAV's `Companion Computer <http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/companion-computers/>`_ can further augment the autopilot â€” performing tasks that are both computationally intensive and require a low-latency link (e.g. computer vision). 

DroneKit is compatible with all vehicles using the `MAVLink protocol <http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start>`_ (including most vehicles made by 3DR and other members of the `DroneCode foundation <https://www.dronecode.org/about/project-members>`_). The APIs can be used in ground-based person computers running Windows, Linux or Mac OS X and with *Companion Computers* running Linux.
